// Models-Views-Controllers
// A web application usually follows MVC architecture, where the portions of your applications are broken up into three parts...

// MODELS => The schemas for your data type and how your application interacts with that data in a database

// VIEWS => Templates that will be rendered into frontend pages for the users consumption

// CONTROLLERS => Your endpoints/routes that coordinate getting the right data from your models, delivering it to your templates and responding the request with the rendered template. The maestro of sorts.

// CRUD
// In MVC, you'll typically need to create the ability to work with your models. The standard types of functionality are summarized by the acronym CRUD.

// C => Create - Ability to create new data

// R => Read - ability to see all or individual pieces of data

// U => Update - ability to change existing data

// D => Delete = ability to remove existing data
